<h1>Animals .... h1 </h1>
This is my super cool page about my favorite animals. For the main heading, I'm using an h1 element.

<h2>Cats .... h2 </h2>
This part is all about cats.

<h3>Cat Behavior .... h3</h3>
This part is about cat behavior.

<h3>Cat Diet .....h3</h3>
This part is about what cats eat.

<h2>Dogs ....h2</h2>
This part is all about dogs.

<h3>Dog Behavior .....h3</h3>
This part is about dog behavior.

<h3>Dog Diet .....h3</h3>
This part is about what dogs eat.<br><br><br>


Notice the two subheadings are the same size they are both h2. 
This implies that these two sections are at the same "level". 
If we wanted to show that the second section ("What is HTML?") was inside the first, 
we could instead make it an h3.
